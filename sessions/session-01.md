## Journal Entry — Rurik Oathless

*Written after the events of the day.*

> We were meant to escort a caravan.  
> Instead, we found dead horses, goblin arrows, and the uncomfortable feeling that whatever Gundrin found, someone else wants badly enough to kill for it.
>
> My companions… a mixed bunch at best. Maybe Baras will prove the mettle of humans, but Valen — pointy ears and quick hands do not make a fighter.  
> Cal Tir is a little too adept at flinging magicks everywhere.
>
> Still, they were all adequate when it came time to clear out the greenskins.
>
> The Boy continues to test his luck with every fight and wears his heart on his sleeve. I’m beginning to suspect the gods are testing us through him.
>
> The cave ahead is dark and wet.  
> Sentries and chained canines at the entrance suggest there may be a proper fight waiting within.
