## Journal

### Rurik Oathless
*Written after the events of the day.*

> Harbin's barely a master of his own bladder, how can he master of a Town?
> There is a menace in Phandalin and no one seems to be able to get rid of it. We're on the case, maybe we'll be able to do some good whilst we're here.
>
> That Halia seems to be a decent woman, as far as women go anyway. Running a Mine and having such a commanding presence..
>
> Sister Gareale may or may not be a Witch..
> It seems like as she knew about holding the Line..
> But even if she is, she seems to be a kind Witch with a noble Purpose.
>
> It felt good to fight underground again.
