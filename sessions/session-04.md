*Written after the events of the day.*

> Not our greatest day, we proved once again we can fight.. But maybe theres more to being an adventurer..
>
> This small town has a lot to offer, no wonder the Lord's Alliance want to set up here.
>
> We're definitely closer to unravelling the Redbrand conspiracy; but it looks like now our only choice is to go in and fight.
> The Manor or the Hole.. we'll have to make a choice and stick to it.
> 
> I still don't understand how our plan didn't work
> Maybe it was The Boy, he doesn't really look like a bandit.
>
> Baras has ..unusual methods for a Cleric.
>
> It is what it is.
> 
> Either way we're back at Stonehill Inn, again. We regroup and try again tomorrow.
