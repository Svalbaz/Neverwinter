### Rurik Oathless
*Written after the events of the day.*

> The cave is not just a den — it is a nest.
>
> Goblins, kobolds, bugbears… different claws, same rot. Someone higher, probably a woman pulling the strings, and the name they whisper is the Green Lord. They mean Lady.  
> Titles mean little — power always smells the same and this smells like a woman.
>
> The Boy fights like a storm given flesh. Fire in his eyes, iron in his hands. Useful in battle — dangerous when allowed to speak. He let that Kobold run away leaving us blind to the dangers that lie ahead.
> Baras still believes words can stop blades. Sometimes they can. Today they could not.
>
> The beast Klarg howled like a broken god when his hound fell.  
> Grief and rage in one sound — I almost respected it.
>
> There is something else in these tunnels.  
> Something that moves unseen. Watches. Waits. I felt it.
>
> And now Sildar lives — but questions remain buried in the dark.
>
> We are no longer escorting a caravan.  
> We are walking into a web.
